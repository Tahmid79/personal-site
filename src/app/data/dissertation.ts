    p1 : `This project involves predicting categories of acute leukemia based on gene expression data and also involves creating 3D and 2D visualizations of the data for various dimensionality reduction algorithms that include sprincipal component analysis, autoencoders, locally linear embedding and a lot more. The novelty of this project is that it uses a transfer learning based approach of combining data from two different public datasets in order to achieve a better classification accuracy through the addition of more data points. The two datasets are projected to a common feature space through the use of dimensionality reduction algorithms where they have the same number of features and afterwards it is possible to apply machine learning algorithms on the data.`,
    p2: `For cancer identification and treatment, traditional approaches such as analyzing the visual appearance of the tumor, and clinical tests have been utilized. The image of the tumor is scanned and processed and subsequently it is compared to already existing samples of images that are known to be infected by cancer. If the tumor is identical to the already known types of tumor, then it is classified accordingly. The problem with this approach is that when two different types of tumor having distinct cancer types appear to be visually similar, it becomes hard 4
    to differentiate them. This can lead to an incorrect diagnosis of cancer and the wrong treatment may be prescribed causing unintended side effects and ineffective treatment. Moreover, even if the same type of cancer seem to be similar, the speed at which it is expanding may not be the same. Some tumors spread out at a faster rate and may require imminent treatment whereas other tumors may be expanding slowly and treatment can be minimal or can even be delayed. So the appearance alone is not providing sufficient details about the tumor and more information is required to be able to correctly identify the type of cancer and choose the most optimum treatment based how severe the condition is.`,
    p3: `An alternative approach to cancer classification is to use the gene expression to predict the type of cancer. Todd Golubâ€™s Dataset of patients containing acute leukemia tissue samples and their respective genes will be used in this study. There are two distinct types of acute leukemia acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Each patient has 7129 individual genes. The set of genes for each patient will be the features. The dimensionality is 7129. However, many of the genes do not have any discriminative power in classifying the two separate cancer types and have no correlation with cancer. Hence dimensionality reduction techniques need to be used. Some of the algorithms tend to overfit due to a very high number of genes that may not have any correlation with any of the cancer types.`
